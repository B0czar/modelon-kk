Dataset Description
(English below)

Contexto
Este conjunto de dados re√∫ne informa√ß√µes reais sobre startups de diferentes setores, incluindo hist√≥rico de rodadas de investimento, valores captados, localiza√ß√£o e √°reas de atua√ß√£o.
O objetivo √© prever se uma startup ter√° sucesso (ativa/adquirida) ou insucesso (fechada) com base nessas vari√°veis.

A base foi adaptada para fins acad√™micos: identificadores, colunas que poderiam gerar vazamento e valores inconsistentes foram removidos. Alguns campos podem conter valores ausentes (NaN), refletindo casos em que o evento n√£o ocorreu ou n√£o foi registrado.

Mais do que buscar o melhor desempenho, este desafio incentiva os participantes a explorar t√©cnicas de pr√©-processamento, sele√ß√£o de vari√°veis e modelagem preditiva aplicadas ao empreendedorismo e inova√ß√£o.

Vis√£o geral
Tarefa: Classifica√ß√£o bin√°ria ‚Äì prever labels (sucesso/insucesso da startup).
Linhas: 923
Colunas: 32
Observa√ß√µes gerais:
Colunas age_* podem ter NaN (evento n√£o ocorreu).
category_code √© uma vari√°vel categ√≥rica bruta.
As demais dummies s√£o bin√°rias 0/1.

1 (sucesso) ‚Üí 597 startups (~64,7%)
0 (insucesso) ‚Üí 326 startups (~35,3%)

üëâ A base est√° moderadamente desbalanceada, mas adequada para modelagem preditiva.

Context
This dataset gathers real information about startups from different sectors, including funding history, amounts raised, location, and industry.
The goal is to predict whether a startup will achieve success (active/acquired) or failure (closed) based on these variables.

The dataset was adapted for academic purposes only: identifiers, leakage-prone fields, and inconsistent values were removed. Some fields may contain missing values (NaN), reflecting cases where the event did not occur or was not recorded.

More than achieving the best performance, this challenge encourages participants to explore preprocessing techniques, feature selection, and predictive modeling applied to entrepreneurship and innovation.

Overview
Task: Binary classification ‚Äì predict labels (success/failure of the startup).
Rows: 923
Columns: 32
General notes:
age_* columns may contain NaN (event not occurred).
category_code is a raw categorical field.
The other dummies are binary 0/1.
Target Variable
labels | int64 | Target | Success indicator | {0, 1} | 1 = success (active/acquired); 0 = closed.
1 (success) ‚Üí 597 startups (~64.7%)
0 (failure) ‚Üí 326 startups (~35.3%)

üëâ The dataset is moderately imbalanced, but still suitable for predictive modeling.

Relative Ages (years since founding to event)
Continuous measures in years, with 2 decimal places. Negative values were treated; NaN means the event did not occur / is unavailable.

age_first_funding_year | float64 | Years until first funding | ‚â• 0 or NaN.
age_last_funding_year | float64 | Years until last funding | ‚â• 0 or NaN.
age_first_milestone_year | float64 | Years until first milestone | ‚â• 0 or NaN (many NaN).
age_last_milestone_year | float64 | Years until last milestone | ‚â• 0 or NaN (many NaN).
Structure, history, and funding scale
relationships | int64 | Count of relationships (founders, executives, investors) | ‚â• 0.
funding_rounds | int64 | Number of funding rounds | ‚â• 0.
funding_total_usd | float64 | Total raised (USD) | Outliers were smoothed (IQR ‚Üí extreme values turned into NaN).
milestones | int64 | Count of relevant milestones | ‚â• 0.
avg_participants | float64 | Average number of investors per round | ‚â• 0.
Location (state dummies ‚Äì binary)
Represents the state where the startup is based. Use as 0/1.
(Replaced state_code, removed to avoid redundancy.)

is_CA, is_NY, is_MA, is_TX, is_otherstate | int64 | State (California, New York, Massachusetts, Texas, Others) | {0,1}.
Industry/market (categorical + dummies)
category_code | object | Declared main sector | string | Requires encoding (One-Hot/Target).
is_software, is_web, is_mobile, is_enterprise, is_advertising, is_gamesvideo, is_ecommerce, is_biotech, is_consulting, is_othercategory | int64 | Industry indicators | {0,1}.
Note: You can keep category_code (and encode it) or work only with the already available dummies.

Funding indicators (rounds and types)
has_VC | int64 | Received venture capital? | {0,1}.
has_angel | int64 | Received angel investment? | {0,1}.
has_roundA, has_roundB, has_roundC, has_roundD | int64 | Had the respective funding round? | {0,1}.
Data notes and policies
Missing values (NaN): mostly in age_* and funding_total_usd outliers ‚Üí handle in the pipeline (e.g., median imputation or robust models).
Scaling: variables like funding_total_usd, relationships, funding_rounds, and avg_participants have different orders of magnitude ‚Üí normalization/standardization (StandardScaler) is recommended for linear models.
Leakage prevention: columns like status, closed_at, is_top500, raw dates, and identifiers were removed.
Balance: check label distribution during training; if needed, use class_weight, threshold tuning, or robust metrics (AUC/F1).
This dataset was adapted for educational purposes and aims to promote hands-on learning in entrepreneurship and predictive modeling.

9. PRIZES
a. Prize(s) are as described on the Competition Website and are only available for winning during the time period described on the Competition Website. The odds of winning any Prize depends on the number of eligible Submissions received during the Competition Period and the skill of the Participants.
b. All Prizes are subject to Competition Sponsor's review and verification of the Participant‚Äôs eligibility and compliance with these Rules, and the compliance of the winning Submissions with the Submissions Requirements. In the event that the Submission demonstrates non-compliance with these Competition Rules, Competition Sponsor may at its discretion take either of the following actions: (i) disqualify the Submission(s); or (ii) require the potential winner to remediate within one week after notice all issues identified in the Submission(s) (including, without limitation, the resolution of license conflicts, the fulfillment of all obligations required by software licenses, and the removal of any software that violates the software restrictions).
c. A potential winner may decline to be nominated as a Competition winner in accordance with Section 3.8.
